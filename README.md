# The negative training data used in EffectorP 2.0 is deposited here. 

This was done using this procedure (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6638006/):
First, secretomes were predicted from the same fungal pathogen/symbiont species as used in the positive set if they had a publicly available predicted gene set (Table 1).
The combined secretome was homology reduced and this resulted in a filtered predicted pathogen secretome of 11277 proteins. 
Then, we applied EffectorP 1.0 to exclude predicted effectors from the secretomes (n = 6138). 

We also collected homology‐reduced sets of secreted fungal proteins from fungi not pathogenic on plants, namely from 27 saprophyte secretomes (n = 12939) 
and from 10 animal‐pathogenic fungal secretomes (n = 2763).
